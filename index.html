    <p>I've been interested in building a website for my future handmade dice business, so I'm happy to be here!</p>
    <p>I'm a senior pursuing my masters in Accounting at CU. I eventually want to do tax work for low income individuals, small businesses, and nonprofits. I have an internship for next summer where I'll work more (hopefully) on the nonprofit tax side. I'm in CTD because I'm a really artsy person and spend a lot of time doing crafty things. I crochet and draw a lot, and also make dice :) I need an outlet away from numbers all the time, so accounting and CTD is a fantastic balance for me.</p>
        
    <p>To get an idea of who I am as a person, if you watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztUH9hlCLrs">this video</a>, you'll get a pretty clear idea of my humor. This video makes me 40% happier every time I watch it and I love it. yay Billy!</p>
