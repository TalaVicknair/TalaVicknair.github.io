            <p>Hi! I’m Tala, and this page links all of my craft adventures, where I’ve been, and where I’m going.</p>
            <p>I go by the name Dizzy in numerous online spaces, and all of my online craft profiles are related to it in some way. Not all of the crafts I have posted are posted online. Crocheting, for example, is just for me and does not have a "brand name."</p>
            <p>Click a link above to see my progress with a number of crafts.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or want to learn how to do one of the crafts that I've posted, talk to me! I know a large number of resources and can help with many different aspects of these crafts.</p>
