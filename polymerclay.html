            <h1>Polymer Clay</h1>
            <p>While I don't work with polymer clay, it was a large part of my childhood in how I got introduced to arts and crafts. From ages 10-14 I would spend a lot of my time making food jewelry and my own beads with polymer clay. I would even make jewelry for my classmates and sell it to them.</p>
            <p>I got introduced to polymer clay crafts because my parents had gotten me a book with some designs and beginner supplies for Christmas one year. I immediately latched on, and made lots of beads and made my own jewelry, which I loved doing before I worked with clay.</p>
            <p>The picture to the left is not of any work that I did. All the work I did was so long ago (and all donated away) so I don't have anything to show for it now. Anything you find online is more advanced than anything I made, but it was a deeply important part of my life.</p>
