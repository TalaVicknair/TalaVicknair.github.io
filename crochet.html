            <h1>Crochet</h1>
            <p>I’ve been crocheting seriously for probably six years now. My Abuelita taught me a long time ago, but I relearned in High School. I’ve crocheted dolls, blankets, pillows, and jackets before.</p>
            <p>The image to the left is the pattern on a 6ft x 4ft blanket that I spent 8 months on. It’s very near and dear to my heart. I’ve taken commissions before, but crochet commissions are not something I like to do, because people aren’t willing to pay for the cost of labor. A blanket fit for a queen sized bed would cost someone $800 for me to make.</p>
            <p>I crochet for fun and for gifts. I’ve given stuffed animals to important people in my life, for example I’ve done a Chihuahua, a Moose, and a Pomeranian. I’m in the process of crocheting a pixel style eeveelution blanket for my boyfriend.</p>
