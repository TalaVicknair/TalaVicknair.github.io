            <h1>Dizzy Dear</h1>
            <p>My current hyperfixation is drawing characters from some of my favorite games and turning them into stickers. To the left is my art of the character Chiaki from Danganronpa, and the sticker I printed out of her. It is 3 inches tall and roughly 1 inch wide.</p>
            <p>Drawing has always been a passion of mine, and something I’ve realized is that turning something into nothing is beautiful for me. It’s why I like such physical crafts. Now that drawing is tangible for me, I’ve never been more proud.</p>
            <p>I have an etsy store that is not yet live, as this is a pretty fresh hobby. Dizzy Dear is the name of my shop, and I expect it to be live within a month. I take commissions for stickers and digital art in general, which I will be adding to my shop.</p>
