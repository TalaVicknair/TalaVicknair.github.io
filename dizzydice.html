            <h1>Dizzy Dice</h1>
            <p>For about 2 years I had a hyperfixation with RPG dice, which resulted in me spending countless hours learning how to make my own resin dice.</p>
            <p>I learned every process from start to finish, which included 3D resin printing, mold making, resin use, inclusions, curing, sanding, polishing, and inking, as well as all general knowledge about resin safety and equipment such as pressure pots and air compressors.</p>
            <p>I became so invested that I convinced myself I would sell my creations one day. The Swirl in the corner was my logo for my brand, Dizzy Dice. It was going to be imprinted on the top face of my D20s.</p>
            <p>As of now dice making is on hold for me. My hyperfixation has passed, and now I am more interested in other crafts.</p>
